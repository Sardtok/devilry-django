<h1>The duck family</h1>
<p>The <b>Duck family</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Fictional_character" title="Fictional character" class="mw-redirect">fictional</a> family created by <a href="/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" title="The Walt Disney Company">The Walt Disney Company</a>. Its best known member is <a href="/wiki/Donald_Duck" title="Donald Duck">Donald Duck</a>.</p> 
<p>In the early 1950s <a href="/wiki/Carl_Barks" title="Carl Barks">Carl Barks</a> was in his second decade of creating <a href="/wiki/Comic_book" title="Comic book">comic book</a> stories starring <a href="/wiki/Donald_Duck" title="Donald Duck">Donald Duck</a> and his various relatives. He had personally created several of the latter. <a href="/wiki/Scrooge_McDuck" title="Scrooge McDuck">Scrooge McDuck</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gladstone_Gander" title="Gladstone Gander" class="mw-redirect">Gladstone Gander</a> being the most notable among them. But the exact relation between them was still somewhat uncertain. Carl decided to create a personal version of their <a href="/wiki/Family_tree" title="Family tree">Family tree</a>. To better define their relations he added several previously unknown relatives. Carl never intended to publish this family tree as he had created it for personal use.</p> 
<p>In 1981 Carl was well into his retirement but his stories remained popular and had gained him unexpected fame. He had given several interviews and answered questions about his personal views on the characters and their stories. Among other subjects, Carl described his early version of the family tree. Rough sketches of the tree were published in a number of <a href="/wiki/Fanzine" title="Fanzine">fanzines</a>. Fans of the characters were pleased for the background it added to them. At this point <a href="/w/index.php?title=Mark_Worden&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mark Worden (page does not exist)">Mark Worden</a> decided to create a drawing of this family tree including portraits of the characters mentioned. Otherwise Mark made few changes to the tree, most notably adding <a href="/wiki/Daisy_Duck" title="Daisy Duck">Daisy Duck</a> as Donald's main love interest. His illustrated version of the tree was published at first in several fanzines and later in the Carl Barks Library. The later was a ten-volume collection of his works in hardcover black-and-white edition.</p> 
<p>In 1987 <a href="/wiki/Don_Rosa" title="Don Rosa">Don Rosa</a>, a long-time fan of Carl Barks and personal friend of Mark Worden, started creating his own stories featuring <a href="/wiki/Scrooge_McDuck" title="Scrooge McDuck">Scrooge McDuck</a> and his various associates. His stories contained numerous references to older stories by Carl as well as several original ideas. After several years he gained a fanbase of his own. In the early 1990s <a href="/wiki/Egmont_(media_group)" title="Egmont (media group)" class="mw-redirect">Egmont</a>, the publishing house employing Don, offered him an ambitious assignment. He was to create the definitive version of Scrooge's biography and a family tree accompanying it. This was supposed to end decades of contradictions between stories which caused confusion to readers. The project was to become <a href="/wiki/The_Life_and_Times_of_Scrooge_McDuck" title="The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck">The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck</a>. The family tree accompanying it was first published in <a href="/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a> on July 3, 1993.</p> 
<p>In the process of working on Scrooge's biography, Don studied Barks' old stories mentioning his past. Then he added several ideas of his own. Among them were biographical information for Scrooge's supporting cast. In a way Scrooge's biography was also their own biography.</p> 

<h2>Duck family members featured in the Family Tree</h2> 
<h3>Pintail Duck</h3> 
<p><b>Pintail Duck</b> first appeared in the story called Back to Long Ago which first appeared in <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Scrooge" title="Uncle Scrooge">Uncle Scrooge</a> #16. In that story it was revealed that he and his friend Matey <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_McDuck" title="Malcolm McDuck" class="mw-redirect">Malcolm McDuck</a> buried a treasure of <a href="/wiki/Potato" title="Potato">potatoes</a> for Captain Loyal Hawk of The Falcon Rover. He drowned three days later and was reborn as his descendant <a href="/wiki/Donald_Duck" title="Donald Duck">Donald Duck</a>.</p> 
<p><a href="/wiki/Don_Rosa" title="Don Rosa">Don Rosa</a> used Pintail in his version of The Donald Duck Family Tree, as the oldest Duck Family member on the tree.</p> 
<h3>Humperdink Duck</h3> 
<p><b>Humperdink Duck</b> is the late husband of <a href="/wiki/Grandma_Duck" title="Grandma Duck" class="mw-redirect">Grandma Duck</a> (Elvira Coot) and grandfather of <a href="/wiki/Donald_Duck" title="Donald Duck">Donald Duck</a>. He worked as a farmer in <a href="/wiki/Duckburg" title="Duckburg" class="mw-redirect">Duckburg</a>. He was the father of three children: Quackmore, Daphne, and Eider Duck. Humperdink Duck appears in person in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Life_and_Times_of_Scrooge_McDuck" title="The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck">The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck</a></i> and has been referred to in a few other stories. He was known as "Pa Duck". Unlike his wife Elvira, whose parents and even a brother were identified by <a href="/wiki/Don_Rosa" title="Don Rosa">Don Rosa</a>, who also decided she's the granddaughter of nothing less than the founder of <a href="/wiki/Duckburg" title="Duckburg" class="mw-redirect">Duckburg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Coot" title="Cornelius Coot" class="mw-redirect">Cornelius Coot</a>, Humperdink's past before having a family with Grandma keeps a mystery. According to Don Rosa, "the Duck family came from the British Isles, probably England".<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p> 
<p>In the story "<a href="https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+DD+++93-05" class="external text" rel="nofollow">The Good Old Daze</a>" by <a href="/wiki/Tony_Strobl" title="Tony Strobl">Tony Strobl</a>, one of the most beloved duck masters of all-time, Grandpa (Humperdink) appears in flashback taking care of little Donald along with Grandma.</p>
