    """

    .. attribute:: parentnode

        A django.db.models.ForeignKey_ that points to the parent node,
        which is always a `Period`_.

    .. attribute:: publishing_time

        A django.db.models.DateTimeField_ representing the publishing time of
        the assignment.

    .. attribute:: anonymous

        A models.BooleanField specifying if the assignment should be
        anonymously for correcters.

    .. attribute:: admins

        A django.db.models.ManyToManyField_ that holds all the admins of the
        Node.

    .. attribute:: assignmentgroups

        A set of :class:`assignmentgroups <devilry.apps.core.models.AssignmentGroup>` for this assignment

    .. attribute:: filenames
    
        A optional string of filenames separated by whitespace.

    .. attribute:: pointscale

        The points will be scaled down or up making the _this_
        number the maximum number of points. Defaults to 1.

    .. attribute:: autoscale
            
        If this field is True, the pointscale will automatically be set
        to the maximum number of points possible with the selected grade
        plugin.

    .. attribute:: maxpoints

        The maximum number of points possible without scaling. This is set by
        the grade plugin.

    .. attribute:: attempts

        The number of attempts a student get on this assignment. This is
        not a hard limit, but it makes the work of the examiners easier
        because the system will close groups (leaving students unable to
        deliver more attempts) when they have this many published
        feedbacks. Examiners can open closed groups, and they are
        notified when a group is automatically closed.

        If this is None, closing of groups has to be handled manually.

    .. attribute:: must_pass
        
        Each student must get a passing grade on this assignment to get a
        passing grade on the period. Defaults to False.


    .. attribute:: examiners_publish_feedbacks_directly

       Should feedbacks published by examiners be made avalable to the
       students immediately? If not, an administrator have to publish
       feedbacks. See also :attr:`Deadline.feedbacks_published`.
       
    .. attribute:: etag

       A DateTimeField containing the etag for this object.
